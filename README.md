# classifier-model
In this project i had built my very first Machine Learning model. 
I had created a Random Forest Classifier model with a 91.7% accuracy using sklearn to build and train the model.  
I then deployed this model to a rest API using FastAPI and got predictions with a valid accuracy on tweets I got from elastic search.
In this repository also is a dockerfile which I used to create my first docker image and set the environments identical to my local.
Overall this project was a lot of fun and got me to understand machine learning, Rest API's and docker images and there environments on a deeper scale.
